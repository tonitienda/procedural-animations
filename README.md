# Procedural animations

## Introduction

As I started programing (more than 20 years ago) I was drawn into two main directions. Let "machines" understand
the workd (Computer Vision) and let "machines" simulate the workd physics. 
In one of my first classes using Visual Basic and WebForms I found myself creating a simple gravity and collision simulation.


After what feels like an eternity working on different projects and technologies, none of them related to that I decided to give
a try again. The first step will be to recreate what I did back then, with different technology.

The goal of this project is to learn about procedural animations and game physics and other things I do not know about.
I will apply ECS (Entities-Components-Systems), although I am not sure about how it works as a way to be exposed to a different way of organizing
logic. 

Indirectly I will practise more Golang and I will learn about WASM.

I found some inspirations here:

- [The coding train](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain)
- [A simple procedural animation technique](https://youtu.be/qlfh_rv6khY?si=X3fdmz8mlzKnu1mf)
